# Elden Ring ASCII Game
Elden-Ring-ASCII is an ASCII adaptation of the popular game Elden Ring. It is built using a game engine provided by Monash University as part of the FIT2099 unit. This project was developed to deepen our understanding and application of SOLID principles and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The primary aim was to design and implement features in the game in a way that they are maintainable and extensible.

For this assignment, our team was tasked with implementing various features based on Elden Ring. We utilized functions from the provided game engine, without modifying the original codebase of the engine itself.
